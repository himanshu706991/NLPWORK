Actualy i need NER 
ChatGPT said:
For creating a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using BERT, we can follow similar steps as before but modify the model to handle token-level predictions. Here's how you can create a BERT-based NER model:

Steps to Create a BERT Model for NER:
Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers datasets torch seqeval
Import Libraries:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer, BertForTokenClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset
from seqeval.metrics import accuracy_score, precision_score, recall_score, f1_score
Load Pre-trained BERT Tokenizer and Model: For NER, we use the BertForTokenClassification model, which is suitable for sequence labeling tasks:

python
Copy
Edit
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=9)  # Change num_labels based on your NER tags
Load and Prepare Data: Let's use the "conll2003" dataset as an example for NER:

python
Copy
Edit
dataset = load_dataset("conll2003")
Tokenize Data: Tokenize the text data and align labels to the tokens:

python
Copy
Edit
def tokenize_and_align_labels(examples):
    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(examples['tokens'], padding="max_length", truncation=True, is_split_into_words=True)
    labels = examples['ner_tags']
    # Adjust labels based on tokenization (to handle wordpieces)
    tokenized_inputs["labels"] = [label + [0] * (len(tokenized_inputs["input_ids"][0]) - len(label)) for label in labels]
    return tokenized_inputs

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True)
tokenized_datasets.set_format(type='torch', columns=['input_ids', 'attention_mask', 'labels'])
Define Evaluation Metrics: NER typically uses metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score, which are computed based on the tokens' predicted labels and true labels:

python
Copy
Edit
def compute_metrics(p):
    predictions, labels = p
    predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)
    true_labels = labels
    # Flatten the arrays to compute the metrics for each token in each sequence
    true_labels_flat = true_labels.flatten()
    predictions_flat = predictions.flatten()
    return {
        'precision': precision_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'recall': recall_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'f1': f1_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'accuracy': accuracy_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat)
    }
Define Trainer and Training Arguments:

python
Copy
Edit
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)
Train the Model:

python
Copy
Edit
trainer.train()
Evaluate the Model: After training, you can evaluate the model's performance on the validation dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
trainer.evaluate()
Explanation:
BertForTokenClassification: This model is designed for token-level tasks like NER. It outputs a label for each token in the input sequence.
Tokenization: The text is tokenized using the BERT tokenizer, and then the labels are aligned with the tokenized tokens.
compute_metrics: We define precision, recall, F1, and accuracy metrics to evaluate the NER model's performance.
Adjusting the Number of Labels:
The number of labels (num_labels) will depend on the specific NER task you're working on. For example, the conll2003 dataset has 9 entity types (e.g., "PER", "ORG", "LOC", "MISC"), but if you're working with a different dataset, you'll need to modify num_labels accordingly and define the appropriate entity types.

Mastering Named Entity Recognition with BERT
ChatGPT said:
Mastering Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT involves a series of steps where you utilize BERT’s powerful language representation capabilities for token classification tasks like NER. Below, we’ll break down key components and best practices for mastering NER using BERT, ensuring you're equipped to tackle complex NER challenges.

1. Understanding the NER Task
NER is the task of identifying entities such as names of people (PER), organizations (ORG), locations (LOC), dates, and more, from a text. In NER, each token (word or sub-word) is classified into one of the pre-defined entity labels or as "O" (outside, meaning no entity).

2. Why BERT for NER?
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is particularly effective for NER due to:

Bidirectional Contextual Representation: BERT understands the context of a word based on both its left and right context, making it more accurate in classifying words in complex sentence structures.
Subword Tokenization: BERT can handle rare and out-of-vocabulary words by breaking them into subword tokens (WordPiece tokens), ensuring better representation of entities.
Pre-training on Large Corpus: BERT is pre-trained on vast amounts of data, enabling it to capture syntactic and semantic relationships in language.
3. Steps to Implement BERT for NER
Step 1: Install Required Libraries
To work with BERT for NER, you will need:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install transformers datasets torch seqeval
Step 2: Load the Dataset
You can use publicly available datasets like conll2003 or ontonotes5 for training a BERT-based NER model. Here’s how to load the conll2003 dataset using the datasets library:

python
Copy
Edit
from datasets import load_dataset
dataset = load_dataset("conll2003")
Step 3: Tokenize the Data
Since NER is a token classification task, tokenizing text into subwords using the BERT tokenizer is crucial. We also need to align entity labels to these tokens.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased')

def tokenize_and_align_labels(examples):
    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(examples['tokens'], truncation=True, padding="max_length", is_split_into_words=True)
    labels = examples['ner_tags']
    
    # Align labels with tokenization output
    tokenized_inputs["labels"] = [label + [0] * (len(tokenized_inputs["input_ids"][0]) - len(label)) for label in labels]
    return tokenized_inputs

tokenized_datasets = dataset.map(tokenize_and_align_labels, batched=True)
Step 4: Model Definition
Use BertForTokenClassification for the NER task. This model will predict a label for each token in the sequence.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification

model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained('bert-base-uncased', num_labels=9)  # Adjust num_labels for your task
Step 5: Define Metrics
Evaluate the model with standard NER metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and accuracy. The seqeval library can be used for this.

python
Copy
Edit
from seqeval.metrics import precision_score, recall_score, f1_score, accuracy_score

def compute_metrics(p):
    predictions, labels = p
    predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)
    true_labels = labels
    true_labels_flat = true_labels.flatten()
    predictions_flat = predictions.flatten()
    return {
        'precision': precision_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'recall': recall_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'f1': f1_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat, average='micro'),
        'accuracy': accuracy_score(true_labels_flat, predictions_flat)
    }
Step 6: Training
Configure the training settings and train the model. The Trainer class from the Hugging Face library simplifies this process:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments

training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir='./results',
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01
)

trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_datasets["train"],
    eval_dataset=tokenized_datasets["validation"],
    compute_metrics=compute_metrics
)

trainer.train()
Step 7: Evaluate the Model
Evaluate the model performance on the test dataset:

python
Copy
Edit
trainer.evaluate()
4. Fine-Tuning Strategies
To master NER, fine-tuning BERT is key. Here are some strategies to improve performance:

Data Augmentation: Augment your training data by adding noise, swapping entities, or using other methods to introduce variability and improve generalization.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters to achieve better performance.
Model Checkpointing: Save model checkpoints to avoid overfitting and ensure you can restore the best-performing model.
5. Handling Long Sequences
BERT has a maximum token limit (typically 512 tokens). If your text exceeds this limit, you can:

Truncate long sequences: Tokenizer can truncate to a fixed length.
Sliding window approach: Split long sequences into overlapping windows and make predictions for each window.
6. Using Pre-trained NER Models
Hugging Face offers pre-trained models for NER, like dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english. You can easily use these models directly for predictions:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline

ner_pipe = pipeline("ner", model="dbmdz/bert-large-cased-finetuned-conll03-english")

text = "Hawking was a renowned physicist at the University of Cambridge."
entities = ner_pipe(text)
print(entities)
7. Advanced NER Topics
NER with Multiple Entity Types: When working with a domain-specific NER task, ensure that your model is aware of the entity types relevant to your task (e.g., medical entities, financial terms).
Entity Linking: After identifying entities, linking them to a knowledge base for more detailed information is an advanced approach in NER.
Transfer Learning: Use domain-specific pre-trained models if you're working with a specialized dataset (e.g., medical or legal texts).
8. Error Analysis and Iterative Improvement
After training, always perform a thorough error analysis:

Entity Type Distribution: Check if the model is misclassifying specific entity types (e.g., "LOC" as "PER").
Contextual Errors: Analyze where the model makes mistakes due to context (e.g., “Apple” as a fruit instead of an organization).
Conclusion
Mastering Named Entity Recognition (NER) with BERT involves understanding how to fine-tune pre-trained models, handle token-level tasks, and optimize for the best performance on NER datasets. By using pre-trained models, fine-tuning with domain-specific data, and evaluating performance through relevant metrics, you can achieve state-of-the-art results.

i have downloaded distil bert and bertbased uncased models also i have manula tagging sheet and  event descroption data  from all of this please buiola NER model
ChatGPT said:
Since you have downloaded DistilBERT and BERT-base-uncased, along with a manually tagged dataset containing event descriptions, we can follow a structured approach to build your custom NER model. Below is a step-by-step guide:

Steps to Build Your Custom NER Model
Load Your Dataset (Manually Tagged Event Description Data)
Preprocess Data (Convert Text + Tags into Token-Level Annotations)
Tokenize Using BERT/DistilBERT
Prepare Dataset for Fine-Tuning
Load Pre-Trained BERT Model for Token Classification
Train the Model
Evaluate the Model
Save & Use for Inference
Step 1: Load Your Manually Tagged Dataset
Since your data is manually tagged, I assume it is in CSV or JSON format, with event descriptions and entity labels.

Example CSV format:

css
Copy
Edit
event_description,entities
"Bank of America faced a cyber attack", [{"start": 0, "end": 16, "label": "ORG"}, {"start": 26, "end": 38, "label": "EVENT"}]
"John Doe resigned from Goldman Sachs", [{"start": 0, "end": 8, "label": "PER"}, {"start": 23, "end": 37, "label": "ORG"}]
Now, load it into pandas:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Load dataset (modify path accordingly)
df = pd.read_csv("event_ner_data.csv")

# Check structure
df.head()
Step 2: Preprocess the Data
We need to convert the event descriptions and entity labels into a format that aligns with BERT’s tokenized output.

Tokenization with WordPiece
Since BERT uses WordPiece tokenization, words may be split into subwords. We must align entity labels accordingly.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer

# Load tokenizer (choose between distilbert or bert-base-uncased)
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Example function to tokenize and align labels
def tokenize_and_align_labels(examples):
    tokenized_inputs = tokenizer(examples['event_description'], truncation=True, padding="max_length", is_split_into_words=True)

    # Align entity labels (convert char-based to token-based)
    labels = []
    for i, label in enumerate(examples["entities"]):
        word_ids = tokenized_inputs.word_ids(batch_index=i)  # Map tokens to original words
        label_ids = []
        for word_idx in word_ids:
            if word_idx is None:
                label_ids.append(-100)  # Ignore padding tokens
            else:
                label_ids.append(label[word_idx] if word_idx in label else 0)  # Assign entity labels
        
        labels.append(label_ids)
    
    tokenized_inputs["labels"] = labels
    return tokenized_inputs

# Apply tokenization
tokenized_dataset = df.apply(tokenize_and_align_labels, axis=1)
Step 3: Convert Data into PyTorch Dataset
Transform the tokenized data into a format usable by PyTorch.

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class EventNERDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings["input_ids"])

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}

# Convert into PyTorch Dataset
dataset = EventNERDataset(tokenized_dataset)
Step 4: Load Pre-trained BERT Model
Since this is a token classification task, we use BertForTokenClassification.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification

# Define the number of labels (modify based on your dataset)
num_labels = len(set(df['entities'].explode()))

# Load model (choose between bert-base-uncased or distilbert-base-uncased)
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=num_labels)
Step 5: Train the Model
Define training arguments and train using Hugging Face's Trainer API.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./ner_results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Trainer object
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=dataset,  # Use train dataset
    eval_dataset=dataset,   # Use validation dataset (split if needed)
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
Step 6: Evaluate the Model
After training, evaluate the performance using seqeval.

python
Copy
Edit
from seqeval.metrics import classification_report

# Get predictions
predictions, labels, _ = trainer.predict(dataset)
predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)

# Convert predictions and labels into readable format
true_labels = [[label for label in label_seq if label != -100] for label_seq in labels]
predicted_labels = [[pred for pred, true in zip(pred_seq, label_seq) if true != -100] for pred_seq, label_seq in zip(predictions, labels)]

# Print classification report
print(classification_report(true_labels, predicted_labels))
Step 7: Save & Use the Model for Inference
Once trained, save the model for future use.

python
Copy
Edit
# Save model and tokenizer
model.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
To load the model and use it for inference:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pipeline for NER
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="custom_ner_model", tokenizer="custom_ner_model")

# Example inference
text = "Apple Inc. was fined for a data breach in California."
entities = ner_pipeline(text)
print(entities)
Final Thoughts
By following this workflow, you've successfully: ✔ Preprocessed manually tagged event descriptions
✔ Aligned tokenization with entity labels
✔ Fine-tuned a pre-trained BERT model
✔ Trained and evaluated the NER model
✔ Saved the model for future inference

You said:
ok let under stand manula tagg file has sentience number and sentence token and tag and venet description file has sentence id and event description also some sentence has null description with set up buil NER model
ChatGPT said:
Got it! You have two separate files:

Manual tagging file → Contains sentence_id, token, and tag.
Event description file → Contains sentence_id and event_description, where some descriptions may be null.
We need to merge these files using sentence_id, handle missing descriptions, and train a BERT-based NER model. Here’s the plan:

📌 Steps to Build the NER Model
1️⃣ Load the Manual Tagging File
2️⃣ Load the Event Description File
3️⃣ Merge Both Files on sentence_id
4️⃣ Handle Missing Descriptions
5️⃣ Tokenize Sentences & Align Labels
6️⃣ Prepare Data for Fine-Tuning
7️⃣ Train the BERT NER Model
8️⃣ Evaluate and Save the Model

Step 1: Load the Manual Tagging File
Assuming your tagging file is in CSV format with columns:

css
Copy
Edit
sentence_id, token, tag
1, Bank, B-ORG
1, of, O
1, America, I-ORG
1, was, O
1, hacked, B-EVENT
Let’s load it:

python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

# Load manual tagging file
tagged_df = pd.read_csv("manual_tagging.csv")

# Check the structure
print(tagged_df.head())
Step 2: Load the Event Description File
Your event description file may look like this:

arduino
Copy
Edit
sentence_id, event_description
1, "Bank of America was hacked last week"
2, "John Doe resigned from Goldman Sachs"
3, ""
Load it and handle null values:

python
Copy
Edit
# Load event description file
event_df = pd.read_csv("event_description.csv")

# Replace empty strings with NaN, then drop
event_df.replace("", pd.NA, inplace=True)

# Display data
print(event_df.head())
Step 3: Merge Both Files
We merge tagged_df and event_df on sentence_id:

python
Copy
Edit
# Merge the datasets on sentence_id
merged_df = pd.merge(tagged_df, event_df, on="sentence_id", how="left")

# Drop rows where event_description is missing (if necessary)
merged_df = merged_df.dropna(subset=["event_description"])

print(merged_df.head())
Step 4: Tokenize Sentences & Align Labels
Since BERT uses subword tokenization, we need to align labels with tokens.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertTokenizer

# Load BERT tokenizer
tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# Tokenize sentences and align labels
def tokenize_and_align_labels(example):
    tokens = tokenizer(example['event_description'], truncation=True, padding="max_length", return_offsets_mapping=True)
    offset_mapping = tokens.pop("offset_mapping")  # Keep track of token-to-word mapping
    
    labels = []
    word_ids = tokens.word_ids()  # Aligning word IDs to tokens
    
    for word_idx in word_ids:
        if word_idx is None:
            labels.append(-100)  # Ignore special tokens
        else:
            label = example['tag'][word_idx] if word_idx in example.index else 'O'
            labels.append(label)
    
    tokens["labels"] = labels
    return tokens

# Apply tokenization
tokenized_dataset = merged_df.apply(tokenize_and_align_labels, axis=1)
Step 5: Convert to PyTorch Dataset
Convert tokenized data into a PyTorch dataset.

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class NERDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings["input_ids"])

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}

# Create Dataset
ner_dataset = NERDataset(tokenized_dataset)
Step 6: Train the NER Model
Load a pre-trained BERT model for Token Classification.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Define number of unique labels
unique_labels = list(set(merged_df["tag"]))
num_labels = len(unique_labels)

# Load pre-trained BERT model
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=num_labels)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./ner_results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
)

# Trainer object
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=ner_dataset,
    eval_dataset=ner_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
Step 7: Evaluate & Save Model
Once trained, evaluate the model and save it.

python
Copy
Edit
from seqeval.metrics import classification_report

# Get predictions
predictions, labels, _ = trainer.predict(ner_dataset)
predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)

# Convert to readable format
true_labels = [[label for label in label_seq if label != -100] for label_seq in labels]
predicted_labels = [[pred for pred, true in zip(pred_seq, label_seq) if true != -100] for pred_seq, label_seq in zip(predictions, labels)]

# Print classification report
print(classification_report(true_labels, predicted_labels))
Save the model:

python
Copy
Edit
# Save model and tokenizer
model.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
Step 8: Load & Use for Inference
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline

# Load pipeline
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="custom_ner_model", tokenizer="custom_ner_model")

# Example text
text = "Microsoft faced a major data breach in 2023."

tokenizer = BertTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

def tokenize_and_align_labels(example):
    tokens = tokenizer(example['event_description'], truncation=True, padding="max_length", return_offsets_mapping=True)
    offset_mapping = tokens.pop("offset_mapping")  # Keep track of token-to-word mapping
    
    labels = []
    word_ids = tokens.word_ids()  # Aligning word IDs to tokens
    
    for word_idx in word_ids:
        if word_idx is None:
            labels.append(-100)  # Ignore special tokens
        else:
            label = example['tag'][word_idx] if word_idx in example.index else 'O'
            labels.append(label)
    
    tokens["labels"] = labels
    return tokens

# Apply tokenization
tokenized_dataset = merged_df.apply(tokenize_and_align_labels, axis=1)
Step 5: Train-Test Split
We'll split the dataset into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split.

python
Copy
Edit
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Split dataset
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(tokenized_dataset, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

print(f"Training samples: {len(train_data)}")
print(f"Testing samples: {len(test_data)}")
Step 6: Convert to PyTorch Dataset
We convert the train-test data into a PyTorch dataset.

python
Copy
Edit
import torch
from torch.utils.data import Dataset

class NERDataset(Dataset):
    def __init__(self, encodings):
        self.encodings = encodings

    def __len__(self):
        return len(self.encodings["input_ids"])

    def __getitem__(self, idx):
        return {key: torch.tensor(val[idx]) for key, val in self.encodings.items()}

# Create train and test datasets
train_dataset = NERDataset(train_data)
test_dataset = NERDataset(test_data)
Step 7: Train BERT for NER
Now, we fine-tune a BERT model for token classification.

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import BertForTokenClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Define number of unique labels
unique_labels = list(set(merged_df["tag"]))
num_labels = len(unique_labels)

# Load BERT for token classification
model = BertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=num_labels)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./ner_results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",  # Evaluate every epoch
    logging_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    save_strategy="epoch"
)

# Trainer object
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=test_dataset,  # Use test dataset for evaluation
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
Step 8: Evaluate on Test Set
We evaluate using the SeqEval library, which is commonly used for NER.

python
Copy
Edit
from seqeval.metrics import classification_report

# Get predictions
predictions, labels, _ = trainer.predict(test_dataset)
predictions = predictions.argmax(axis=-1)

# Convert to readable format
true_labels = [[label for label in label_seq if label != -100] for label_seq in labels]
predicted_labels = [[pred for pred, true in zip(pred_seq, label_seq) if true != -100] for pred_seq, label_seq in zip(predictions, labels)]

# Print classification report
print(classification_report(true_labels, predicted_labels))
This will give you:

Precision
Recall
F1-score
for each named entity.
Step 9: Save & Load Model for Inference
After training, save the model and tokenizer.

python
Copy
Edit
# Save model and tokenizer
model.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
tokenizer.save_pretrained("custom_ner_model")
Now, load the model for inference:

python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import pipeline

# Load the fine-tuned NER model
ner_pipeline = pipeline("ner", model="custom_ner_model", tokenizer="custom_ner_model")

# Test on a sample sentence
text = "Apple acquired a cybersecurity startup in 2024."

# Run inference
entities = ner_pipeline(text)
print(entities)
📌 Final Summary

You said:
were we rae using distil bert 
ChatGPT said:
Right now, the code is using BERT-base-uncased, but we can easily switch to DistilBERT for a lighter model with fewer parameters.

🔄 Why Use DistilBERT?
40% smaller than BERT
60% faster inference
Retains ~97% of BERT’s performance
Since your use case is NER, using DistilBERT can still provide good accuracy while improving speed.
📌 How to Use DistilBERT for NER
We only need to make two changes:
1️⃣ Change BertTokenizer → DistilBertTokenizer
2️⃣ Change BertForTokenClassification → DistilBertForTokenClassification

Updated Code
python
Copy
Edit
from transformers import DistilBertTokenizer, DistilBertForTokenClassification, TrainingArguments, Trainer

# Load DistilBERT tokenizer
tokenizer = DistilBertTokenizer.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased")

# Define number of labels
unique_labels = list(set(merged_df["tag"]))
num_labels = len(unique_labels)

# Load DistilBERT for token classification
model = DistilBertForTokenClassification.from_pretrained("distilbert-base-uncased", num_labels=num_labels)

# Define training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./distilbert_ner_results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    logging_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=5e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    per_device_eval_batch_size=16,
    num_train_epochs=5,
    weight_decay=0.01,
    logging_dir="./logs",
    save_strategy="epoch"
)

# Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=train_dataset,
    eval_dataset=test_dataset,
)

# Train the model
trainer.train()
📌 What Changed?
✔ Tokenizer → DistilBertTokenizer
✔ Model → DistilBertForTokenClassification
✔ Training Configurations Remain the Same

With this, you're now using DistilBERT instead of BERT, making it lighter and faster while keeping accuracy close. 🚀
